## Introduction
 - The primary goal is to help you solve problems using computer code
 - Programming is an important tool in problem solving process
 - If you have strong programming fundamentals, you can lean other languages   fairly easily.
 - Fundamentals are similar across different languages
 - Just like if you lean engish you can pick up other languages faster

 ## History
 C has been around a really long time since 1970s

 - 1960 - Algol
 - 1967 - BCPL
 - 1970 - B
 - 1972 - Traditional C
 - 1978 - K & RC
 - 1989 - ANSI C
 - 1990 - ANSI/ISO C

C as a language is widely popular and has been changing over
the years.

You will learn over time that there is no such thing as the best 
programming language. There are lots of them.

They are designed to be good at certain things. All programming languages
have advantages and disadvantages

The proper programming language to use is dependent on the problem
you are trying to solve. Certain problems are better suited for certain languages. There is no single tool that can solve all sorts of problems

C programming is really great for Systems programming. Systems programming has 
alot to do with undewrlying hardware and management of hardware resources

Almost all operating systems and embedded systems are written in C

### Why C Language
- C allows the programmer alot of control and flexibility compared to other languages. 
- C is a building block, as it manages system resources. Other languages such as Go, PHP are built ontop of C

Electrical and computer engineers learn C, as it allows greater control of system resources. C is great for embedded systems, code logic that is embedded into special purpose device e.g sensors

Consider a complicated system(embedded system) such as a jet engine
A jet engine has alot of complicated stuff going on mechanical stuff, electrical work, computation work, all sorts of logic and sensors. C is very good for systems such as these. C codes can be written for these jet enginees and rely on these systems, managing fuel, flight paths, thrust e.t.c.
